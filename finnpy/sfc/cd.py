    Calculates the directional absolute coherence from complex coherency.
    
    As the coherence is similar to the Fouier Transform of the Pearson correlation coefficient, the magnitude informs of the strength of the correlation and whereas the sign of the imaginary part informs on the direction.
    
    Important design decision: 
    - In case data_2 happens before data_1, the sign of the psi (used to gain directional information) is defined to be positive.
    - In case data_1 happens before data_2, the sign of the psi (used to gain directional information)  is defined to be negative.
    
    The sign of the imaginary part of the coherence is a sine with a frequency of f = 1 in [-180°, 180°]. Naturally, there are two roots of this sine, one at 0° and another at -180°/180°. Around these root phase shifts, the calculated sign is proportionally more sensetive to noise in the signal. Therefore, in case of phase shifts from [-thresh°, +thresh°] the amplitude is corrected to 0. Furthermore, any same_frequency_coupling with a phase shift of ~0° is (mostly) indistingusihable from volume conduction effects.
    
    :param data: List of outer window complex coherency estimates calculated from two signals.
    :param bins: Frequency bins of the complex coherency data.
    :param fmin: Minimum frequency of the frequency range on which coherency gets evaluated.
    :param fmax: Maximum frequency of the frequency range on which coherency gets evaluated.
    :param return_signed_conn: Flag whether the absolute coherence should be multiplied with [-1, 1] for directional information
    :param minimal_angle_thresh: The minimal angle (phase shift) to evaluate in this analysis. Any angle smaller than the angle defined by minimal_angle_thresh is considered volume conduction and therefore replace with np.nan.
    :param volume_conductance_ratio: Defines the ratio of below threshold connectivity values to identify volume conductance.
    
    :return: Connectivity between data_1 and data_2 measured using the directionalized absolute coherence.
