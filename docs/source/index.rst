To this end, FiNNPy provides a number of methods which support the analysis of electrophysiological data. This support is expanded to a broad scope from basic digital signal processing, to file IO, statistical analysis, visualization & most importantly, a number of different metrics to evaluate same frequency connectivity and cross frequency connectivity. 

FiNNPy was designed with primarily EEG, EMG & MEG data in mind, but can easily
