===============

FiNN is a toolbox for the analysis of electrophysiological to *Fi*\nd
*N*\europhysiological *N*\etworks. To this end, FiNN provides a number of
methods which support the analysis of electrophysiological data. This support
is expanded to a broad scope from basic digital signal processing, to file IO,
statistical analysis, visualization & most importantly, a number of different
metrics to evaluate same frequency connectivity and cross frequency
connectivity. 

FiNN was designed with primarily EEG, EMG & MEG data in mind, but can easily
utilized for the analysis of related electrophysiological data. 

Demo applications of the included modules are available in the finn_demo folder.
